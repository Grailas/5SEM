- Copy the file into your Unity Project
- Create a new material in Unity using the shader
- In the material, apply two different cubemaps

Included in the folder is UglyPanorama.jpg, which can be used as a cubemap. To use it:
- Copy/import it into your Unity Project
- In the textures import settings:
-- Set Texture Shape to Cube
-- Set Mapping to Latitude-Longtitude
-- Apply changes
- The texture now works as a cubemap
